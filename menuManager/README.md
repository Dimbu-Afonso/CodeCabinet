## Simple Menu Manager
The owner of a Cafe needs an application to **manage the menu offered in the establishment**. Items and the corresponding prices are grouped under 4 categories: 

 1. Hot Drinks  
 2. Cold Drinks  
 3. Fast Food  
 4. Desserts

The owner wants to be able to pick any of the following tasks to perform: 

 - List all the categories mentioned above including their active
   menu items respectively as well as their corresponding prices under
   each of them.
   
 - Add a new item with its price under an appropriate category.
   
   
 - Inactivate a specific item with its price. This item should be
   moved to where all inactive items are stored. This will enable the
   owner to bring it back when he finds it appropriate.
    
 - List all inactivated items as well as their prices by choosing a
   particular category.
   
 - Activate a specific item including its price(i.e: move the item
   from the inactive items. Once the task is performed, the owner needs
   to access it under active items and not under inactive ones).
   
   
 - Remove an item permanently (permanent removal applies only for
   inactive items).
